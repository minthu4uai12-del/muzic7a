/*
  # Fix infinite recursion in admin_users policies

  1. Problem
    - The admin_users table has a policy that references itself, causing infinite recursion
    - This affects all queries that involve admin checks

  2. Solution
    - Drop the problematic recursive policy
    - Create a simple, non-recursive policy for admin_users
    - Ensure other tables don't create circular dependencies

-- This policy allows any authenticated user to read admin_users table
-- The application logic will handle admin verification
